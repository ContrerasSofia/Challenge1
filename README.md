# Challenge 1

## Description

This challenge was created for a boot camp student who was going through the week 1.
The CSS was remorked to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.
